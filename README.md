Steam-Game-Filter
=================

Filter a users games on steam. I created this to see all the multi-player games that I own and compare them with my friends.

On a side note, this doesn't include free-to-play games like Team Fortress 2 or DOTA 2. If you want to include those, add '&nclude_played_free_games=1' to the end of users_games
